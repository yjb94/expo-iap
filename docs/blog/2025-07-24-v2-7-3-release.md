We're excited to announce the release of expo-iap v2.7.3, which brings full support for Google Play Billing Library v8.0.0! This update ensures compatibility with the latest Android billing features and improved error handling.

## 🚀 What's New

### Google Play Billing Library v8.0.0 Support
- **Upgraded billing library** from v6.2.1 to v8.0.0
- **Enhanced error handling** with sub-response codes for better debugging
- **Improved API compatibility** with updated callback signatures

### Key Changes
- Updated `queryProductDetailsAsync` callback to use `QueryProductDetailsResult`
- Enhanced `enablePendingPurchases` with proper parameter configuration
- Removed deprecated hardcoded Kotlin version constraints

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### Android Kotlin Version Requirement
**Important:** Google Play Billing Library v8.0.0 requires Kotlin 2.0+, but `expo-modules-core` doesn't support Kotlin v2 yet. You need to configure your project with `expo-build-properties`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "android": {
            "kotlinVersion": "2.0.21"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

## 📦 Installation

If you're upgrading to v2.7.3:

```bash
npx expo install expo-iap@2.7.3
```

Don't forget to add the `expo-build-properties` configuration to your `app.json` if you haven't already!

## 🔧 Migration Guide

### For Existing Projects
1. Update to expo-iap v2.7.3
2. Add `expo-build-properties` plugin configuration to your `app.json`
3. Run `npx expo prebuild --clean` to regenerate native code
4. Test your purchase flows to ensure everything works correctly

### Why This Change?
Google Play Billing Library v8.0.0 introduces several improvements:
- Better error handling with detailed sub-response codes
- Enhanced product fetching with unfetched product tracking
- Improved security and performance

However, it requires Kotlin 2.0+, which conflicts with expo-modules-core's current Kotlin version requirements. The expo-build-properties solution provides a clean workaround until expo-modules-core supports Kotlin v2.
