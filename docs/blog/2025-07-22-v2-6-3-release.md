# 2.6.3 - iOS AppTransaction Support

We're excited to announce the release of expo-iap version 2.6.3, which includes critical fixes for iOS AppTransaction functionality.

<!-- truncate -->

## What's New

### Complete AppTransaction Properties

The `getAppTransactionIOS()` function now returns all properties available from Apple's StoreKit 2 AppTransaction API:

```typescript
export type AppTransactionIOS = {
  appTransactionID: string;
  bundleID: string;
  appVersion: string;
  originalAppVersion: string;
  originalPurchaseDate: number;
  deviceVerification: string;
  deviceVerificationNonce: string;
  environment: string;
  signedDate: number;
  appID?: number;
  appVersionID?: number;
  originalPlatform: string;
  preorderDate?: number;
};
```

### Key Properties Added

- **`appTransactionID`**: The unique identifier for the app transaction
- **`environment`**: Indicates whether the transaction occurred in Production, Sandbox, or Xcode environment
- **`signedDate`**: The date when the transaction was signed
- **`appID`** and **`appVersionID`**: App Store identifiers for the app and version
- **`originalPlatform`**: The platform where the app was originally purchased
- **`preorderDate`**: Available when the app was pre-ordered

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { getAppTransactionIOS } from 'expo-iap';

const getAppPurchaseInfo = async () => {
  try {
    const appTransaction = await getAppTransactionIOS();
    
    console.log('App Transaction ID:', appTransaction.appTransactionID);
    console.log('Environment:', appTransaction.environment);
    console.log('Original Purchase Date:', new Date(appTransaction.originalPurchaseDate));
    
    // Check if app was pre-ordered
    if (appTransaction.preorderDate) {
      console.log('Pre-order Date:', new Date(appTransaction.preorderDate));
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to get app transaction:', error);
  }
};
```

## Why This Matters

The AppTransaction API provides crucial information about the app's purchase and installation:

- **Verify app authenticity**: Use the device verification data to ensure the app is legitimate
- **Track installation source**: Determine if the app was purchased, redeemed, or installed via TestFlight
- **Environment detection**: Easily identify if you're running in production or sandbox
- **Pre-order support**: Handle pre-ordered apps appropriately

## Requirements

- iOS 16.0 or later
- The function will throw an error on older iOS versions

## Bug Fixes

This release also includes:
- Fixed missing properties in AppTransaction type definition
- Corrected property names to match Apple's API exactly
- Fixed TypeScript type exports
- Fixed iOS build errors for `appTransactionID` and `preorderDate` mapping
- Made `originalPlatform` optional as it's only available in iOS 18.4+

## Upgrading

To upgrade to version 2.6.3:

```bash
npm install expo-iap@2.6.3
# or
yarn add expo-iap@2.6.3
# or
bun add expo-iap@2.6.3
```

## What's Next

We're continuing to improve the iOS integration and will be adding more StoreKit 2 features in upcoming releases. Stay tuned!
